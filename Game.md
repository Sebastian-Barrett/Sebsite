# My Game
<div class="clearfix">
    <img alt="Game" src="/sebsite/images/game.jpg" class="rightfloat">
    <p>I made a board game because it was a combination of CNC, laser cutting and 3D printing and I wanted to design game rules. It takes elements from Chess, Catan and Quoridor.</p>
    <p>The basic idea is that you start with a lord on the edge of the board and the first player to get their lord to the center wins. You gain coins and walls from having pieces positioned on certain tiles. Coins are used to buy pieces and walls can be used to block opponents or protect yourself.</p>

## Pieces

    <p>I 3d printed all the pieces which allowed me to make a lot of amazing geometries. The pieces were plenty durable so long as I didn't make any super thin parts. The only limitation I had was not including overhangs because I didn't want to print supports.</p>
