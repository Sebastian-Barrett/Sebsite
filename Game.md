# My Game
<div class="clearfix">

<p>I made a board game because it was a combination of CNC, laser cutting and 3D printing and I wanted to design game rules. It takes elements from chess, Catan and Quoridor.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you start with a lord on the edge of the board and the first player to get their lord to the center wins. </p>
