# Laser Cutting
Laser cutting is a very quick method to make 2D parts out of wood or acrylic. I have used it to create artistic pieces and functional parts. 
I use laser cutting in most of projects because it is so quick and useful. My other projects that use laser cutting are my [clock](/sebsite/clock), [chess boards](/sebsite/chess), [game](/sebsite/game), [puzzle box](/sebsite/puzzlebox), and [robot](/sebsite/robot).

## Maps

### Friction fit
I designed all the parts to friction fit, which took a lot of trial and error.
