# Laser Cutting
Laser cutting is a very quick method to make 2D parts out of wood or acrylic. I have used it to create artistic pieces and functional parts. 
I use laser cutting in most of projects because it is so quick and useful. My other projects that use laser cutting are my [clock](/sebsite/clock), [chess boards](/sebsite/chess), [game](/sebsite/game), [puzzle box](/sebsite/puzzlebox), and [robot](/sebsite/robot).

## Drawings

    <p>The laser cutter can engrave grey-scale images by modulating the power of the laser to the darkness of the pixel. So black engraves deeply and white is not touched. This works well for engraving photos of drawings, however some of the contrast is lost because increasing the power of the laser can just deepen the cut rather than darkening the wood. The pieces here were drawn by some of my more artistic friends. </p>

## Maps
<div class="clearfix">
    <img alt="Map" src="/sebsite/images/sydney.jpg" class="thinrightfloat">
    <p>Maps are super easy to make because using the same method as engraving drawings. I used an online map creator to get the black and white images, them simply sent them to the laser. These maps are of Perth and Sydney, where I grew up and live.</p>

### Friction fit
I designed all the parts to friction fit, which took a lot of trial and error.
