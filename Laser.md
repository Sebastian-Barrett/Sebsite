# Laser Cutting
Laser cutting is a very quick method to make 2D parts out of wood or acrylic. I have used it to create artistic pieces and functional parts. 
I use laser cutting in most of projects because it is so quick and useful. My other projects that use laser cutting are my [clock](/sebsite/clock), [chess boards](/sebsite/chess), [game](/sebsite/game), [puzzle box](/sebsite/puzzlebox), [parametric designs](/sebsite/parametric) and [robot](/sebsite/robot).


## Drawings

    <p>The laser cutter can engrave grey-scale images by modulating the power of the laser to the darkness of the pixel. So black engraves deeply and white is not touched. This works well for engraving photos of drawings, however some of the contrast is lost because increasing the power of the laser can just deepen the cut rather than darkening the wood. The pieces here were drawn by some of my more artistic friends. </p>

## Maps

    <p>Maps are super easy to make because using the same method as engraving drawings. I used an online map creator to get the black and white images, them simply sent them to the laser. These maps are of Perth and Sydney, where I grew up and live.</p>

## Kinetic art

    <p>Laser cutting can also be used for more engineering work because it create any 2D part. This is a moving art piece I created because I was board. The crank down the bottom is connected by two oppositely strung rubber band transmission belts to the two turing disks on top. This makes the spiky parts rotate opposite directions and creates and interesting optical effect.</p>

## Mouse cage

    <p>My university hall was going through a prank war so I decided to join in my own special way by creating a mouse cage puzzle for a computer mouse. I designed all the parts in 2D, cut them out and assembled them with hot glue. The cage is in two parts: the top with the bars fits onto the bottom, and the bottom has 4 friction fit pins that hold the top in place. The locking pins are hidden by a skirt so the bottom appears solid. I added a little working mouse wheel, which was interesting to make because it is not aa flat 2D part. I used a wood bending technique where lots of lines are cut into thin wood as shown. </p>

## Friction fit
I designed all the parts to friction fit, which took a lot of trial and error.
