## Fourier series
Fourier series work by summing specific sine waves to approximate a periodic function such as a square wave. The Fourier series for the square wave is:

$$
y=\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\frac{\sin((2n-1)x)}{2n-1}}
$$

$$N=1,2,3$$ are shown with the red, blue, and purple curves, $$N=100$$ is the black curve, and the square wave function is the green line which the fourier series equals when $$N=\infty$$.
