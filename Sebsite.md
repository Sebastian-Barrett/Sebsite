# Sebsite
I built this website because I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Lots of my other projects taught me how to create but this one also taught me how to present my work. 

## Code
Sebsite is hosted for free on <a href="https://github.com/Sebastian-Barrett/sebsite">Github</a> and uses a builder called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to take in markdown (text), images, HTML and CSS and produce the HTML and CSS pages for the website which are served from Github when you open a page. 
HTML is a language which defines the content of the page (title, text, images) and CSS is a language which determines how the HTML is presented on the website.
I started with a Jekyll theme called minima which gave me a lot of basic CSS styling for layout. I then modified this to add any extra elements that I wanted for my website (like the logo and bottom navigation bar) and wrote all the content for the pages. 

## Content

### Rendering 

### Gifs


### 3D models


### Logo
I happened to find a neat idea for a log in my parametric curves exploration. I defined an curve:
<div class="clearfix">
    \begin{flalign}
        $$(X,Y) \\
        X=cos(3t) \\
        Y=sin(2t) \\
        0 \leq t \leq \pi \\ $$
    \end{flalign}
    <img alt="Sgraph" src="/sebsite/images/sgraph.jpg" id="rightfloat" width="100" height="100">
</div>
