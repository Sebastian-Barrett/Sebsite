# Python
I taught myself python because it is amazing and super useful. I have used python for creating [parametric curves](/sebsite/parametric), [rendering animations](/sebsite/rendering) and other little projects.


## Evolution
One of my first projects was a small evolution simulator with food, herbivores and carnivores, where the herbivore and carnivorous had to competitively evolve to survive. They evolved their speed, number of children and energy to reproduce in order to survive the evolution in the opposite species. The carnivores only chase herbivores that were slower than them by a certain evolved stat.

## Games
I also like applying python to games because trying to create an algorithm to play is a larger challenge than the game itself. For example I created a sudoku solver which implemented basic sudoku operations to eliminate most possibilities and then used a tree approach to brute force all the other possibilities. I have also created a poker probability program which deduced the probability of winning with a certain hand at each stage in the game. Calculating the pure probabilities proved to be too difficult, so I simply simulated a couple thousand random games from whatever stage the game was and counted how many I won. However this probability information was not very helpful in playing poker because of course it wasn't (it is a people game).
