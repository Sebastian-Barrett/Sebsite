# Python
I taught myself python because it is amazing and super useful. I have used python for creating [parametric curves](/sebsite/parametric), [rendering animations](/sebsite/rendering) and other little projects.


## Evolution
One of my first projects was a small evolution simulator with food, herbivores and carnivores, where the herbivore and carnivorous had to competitively evolve to survive. They evolved their speed, number of children and energy to reproduce in order to survive the evolution in the opposite species. The carnivores only chase herbivores that were slower than them by a certain evolved stat.
