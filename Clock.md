# Clock

With transparent gears, wooden styling, and a giant pendulum this is a truly epic project. I learnt to design and model, test and fail, assemble and refine. 
I designed the clock of 11 laser cut gears to use energy from a falling weight and timing from a swinging pendulum to tell time for 2 hours at a time. 

## Mechanics

The ticking pendulum allows the escapement (first gear) to move a small amount each swing. Then the frequency of rotation is decreased to once per minute and connected to the second hand. then two pairs of gears decrease the frequency again to once per hour, which is connected to the minute hand. Finally another two pairs reduces it again to power the hour hand. In the middle of the minute to hour transition the weight is connected to provide torque to the whole system that causes the gears to rotate. The weight is attached via a my personally designed ratchet, so that it can be rewound.
The pendulum is a threaded rob with a bob on it that can be screwed up and down. This changes the frequency of the the pendulum so that the clock must be tuned to accuracy.
