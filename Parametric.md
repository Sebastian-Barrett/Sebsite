# Parametric curves
> Pretty math

Parametric curves are curve where the x and y positions are defined by functions eg. $$(\cos(3t),\sin(2t))$$. I have used them for years to make interesting patterns and animations with [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and [python](/sebsite/python). I use them in [laser cutting](/sebsite/laser), [rendering](/sebsite/rendering), [puzzle box](/sebsite/puzzlebox), the [sebsite logo](/sebsite/sebsite), and [CNC](/sebsite/cnc).

    <p>The first cool thing I did with parametric functions was in <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">desmos</a>, an excellent graphing calculator. I defined a parametric curve as a path and them made a lot of points follow that path all at slightly faster speeds. This is super simple but the emergent behaviors are beautiful to watch. You can play with my graph <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vdyulhrk8k">here</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>Python + rendering engine > graphing calculator</blockquote>
    When I started teaching myself python I quickly realized I could do so much more than with a graphing calculator, which lead to me finding a rendering engine to use with python. I did some of the same 2D things, but was also able to expand into 3D parametric curves and model waves in 2D planes and 3D volumes. Look at some of these renderings on my <a href="/sebsite/rendering">rendering</a> page.

## Coasters
These coasters have all been [laser cut](/sebsite/laser) with parametric designs.
