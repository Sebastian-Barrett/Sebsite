# Circus
>Fun, but useless
I have been learning circus skills since 2012and they are a great way to relax. I have done lots inventing and experimenting in my juggling and staff spinning and developed my own styles of both.

## Fire staff
At UNSW I joined the [Circus society](http://circusoc.com/) and they greatly increased my abilites by introducing me to fire staff and clubs.
