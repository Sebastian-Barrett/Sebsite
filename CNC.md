This is highly useful manufacturing method 
## Grand Teton

    <p>The Grand Teton is a mountain in Wyoming that my dad climbed and I decided to make him a mini topographical map of it because I wanted to try topographical CNC. I downloaded a STL file of the mountain from an online <a href="https://jthatch.com/Terrain2STL/">terrain to STL converter</a>. I started with a big 8mm end mill for aggressive clearing and then did finer stepdowns with a smaller 6mm end mill and finishing parallel passes with a small 3mm ball mill.</p>

## Wave

    <p>This is water ripple frozen into wood. I used my <a href="/sebsite/python">python DXF program</a> to convert a wave equation to DXF file. I modelled my wave as a cosine wave with an exponential decay:
    \(y = a*e^(b*x)*\cos{c*x}\)
    Then in rhino I revolved that curve to make the wave surface.</p>
