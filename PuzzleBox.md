## Designing

I designed the puzzle box joint by joint and then assembled the joints onto the pieces. There were a lot of considerations I had to manage:

- Each piece can only milled from one direction
- All internal corners have a minimum radius
- I have to create the pieces to be milled with the available bits
- The maximum milling height is about 50mm 
- The faces of all had to be offset by 0.2mm to allow for a good tolerance friction fit

    <p>In order to make joints in all directions I had to glue small parts into the main pieces. To determine the offset required for the a good friction fit I had to make a test piece, with offsets of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2mm on different sides.</p>

    <p>Once the parts had been milled I ran the bandsaw along the bottom to separate the pieces from the remaining stock. Then I glued, sanded, laser scored and oiled the cube to make the final product. I used 6 parametric designs, created from parametric curves</p>
