# Puzzle Box

    <blockquote>Simple to solve<br>Hard to make</blockquote>
    <p>My puzzle box has 8 pieces that fit together smoothly with a variety of strange joints I designed. I designed in on the computer then milled it out of a plank of pine and lasered designs on the sides. It took me about 6 weeks of learning to make.</p>

## Designing
<iframe src="https://gmail1265769.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcff3c910967c45a5b6?mode=embed" class="viewer3d" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
I designed the puzzle box joint by joint and then assembled the joints onto the pieces. There were a lot of considerations I had to manage:

- Each piece can only milled from one direction
- All internal corners have a minimum radius
- I have to create the pieces to be milled with the available bits
- The maximum milling height is about 50mm 
- The faces of all had to be offset by 0.2mm to allow for a good tolerance friction fit

    <p>In order to make joints in all directions I had to glue small parts into the main pieces. To determine the offset required for the a good friction fit I had to make a test piece, with offsets of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2mm on different sides.</p>

## Milling

    <p>I designed the milling path on Fusion 360 in several stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Facing stock above the parts</li>
        <li>Clearing smaller details</li>
        <li>Milling some vertical curves</li>
        <li>Contouring the pieces top outlines with a down-cutter</li>
        <li>Contouring the rest of the depth with an up-cutter</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once the parts had been milled I ran the bandsaw along the bottom to separate the pieces from the remaining stock. Then I glued, sanded, laser scored and oiled the cube to make the final product. I used 6 <a href="/sebsite/parametric">parametric designs</a> to create the laser patterns on the sides:</p>
