# Three player chess

    <blockquote>Because I couldn't just build a simple chess board</blockquote>
    <p>I chose this project because I always wanted to make a proper and beautiful chess set. I got to practice some interesting woodwork and learn the lathe. It took me about 150 hours over many weeks. The result is a unique handcrafted piece, with a fine board and many imperfect chessmen. I designed the board in two halves in order to make it more portable and embedded magnets to hold it together. I designed the pieces to be quite traditional and for each of the main pieces to have some extra modification after the lathe. </p>
    <p>I got the rules of this variant of three player chess from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMLVaFImzVs" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>

    <p>I used CNC to make the strange quadrilateral shaped tiles out of some Jarrah and Marri placks. The design of the tile shapes comes from dividing the sides and center lines of a hexagon into 8 equal segments and drawing lines between certain points. After modeling the board I did the CAM in Fusion 360 and then milled it out on a symbiosis mill. I left stock on the bottom of the board and then ran each board through the bandsaw to separate the tiles from the board.</p>

    <img alt="Assembled board" src="/sebsite/images/3_assembled.jpg" class="rightfloat">
    <p>Assembling the board was like solving a strange jigsaw puzzle. Then I had a very complicated glue up to create the two board halves. I had to make a few jigs that translated between the hexagonal shape of the board and the orthogonal geometry needed for clamping. I glued the tiles to a plywood board for some extra holding. To complete the board I added a felt bottom and a marri boarder from some of my leftover scraps. I routed a 1mm channel halfway up the side of the board so that I could fold the felt base up in between the board and the boarder. This concealed the edge of the felt and made it less likely to peel off. Then I glued the felt and boarder on with Mod Podge and PVA.</p>

    <img alt="Sanding" src="/sebsite/images/3_sanding.jpg" class="rightfloat">
    <p>After glueing, the joining edge of the board halves was not completely straight due to the complexity of the glue up. I fixed this by cutting off an unnoticeable amount with the track saw. I also sanded the top flat with the orbital sander, which took a while because of a height difference between the jarrah and marri tiles. I drilled four holes for magnets in the two sides of the board and then glued the magnets and wood plugs in. </p>
    <p>To finish the board I used 3 coats of Tung oil, sanding with 800 grit between each. Each coat left the surface slightly streaky so I sanded to 1200 on the final coat of Tung oil and then applied beeswax for a matt finish and to removing the sanding dust. </p>

## Pieces 
For a three player chess board I needed 48 chess pieces, which meant I got a lot of practice on the lathe... 

I spent a bit of time learning about how to lathe (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXzEjCorWO0" target="_blank">my favorite video</a>) and practising. 
I designed my pieces to be quite traditional and combined lots of features I liked. I decided to keep the same base profile and base diameter for all the pieces. I used my designs to create 6 laser cut outlines of the profiles I wanted so that I could make my pieces reasonably similar.

### Weighting
<div class="clearfix">
    <img alt="Piece holder jig" src="/sebsite/images/3_piece_holder.jpg" class="rightfloat">
    <p>I also wanted my pieces to be weighted so I used broken 6mm carbide endmills from the CNC mill (because we have a lot of broken ones). To break the carbide to useable lengths I used a hammer and vice because it was too hard to cut easily. I made a jig to hold the pieces and drilled a hole for the carbide. Then I used hot glue to seal the hole and make the base flat.
